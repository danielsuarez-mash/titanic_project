# titanic_project
Code repository for Kaggle's Titanic ML project.

The purpose of this project is to build some fundamental data science skills. Namely:

### ML Development
- Exploratory data analysis
  - What insights can we gather from the data?
  - What could be helpful to an ML model when trying to predict the target variable?
- Feature selection and engineering
  - What improvements can we make to a feature to improve ML performance?
- Model selection/evaluation
  - How can we select the best performing model?
  - What model evaluation graphs are the most relevant for this task?


###Â ML Operations
- Interact with data using PostgreSQL
- Containerise project using Docker
- Implement logging
- Modularise code
